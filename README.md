# The Gallerist Online Multiplayer Board Game

Our project is a web-based implementation of a physical board game called The Gallerist. This project aims to bring a fun board game online for more users to experience and enjoy while adding useful features for an online community including tournaments, chat rooms, ranking, metrics and more. We want to bring the excitement of a new board game with a small community online so that more people can enjoy and learn this delightful game!
